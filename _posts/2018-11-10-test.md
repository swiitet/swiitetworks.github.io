Hey, what's up? Today we are talking about effect of positivity on body. Let's get started.

**Just a few hours to lose sleep, especially in frustrating situations makes you quite annoyed.**

According to the new Iowa State University study, only a few hours of sleep at night, especially in frustrating situations makes you very annoying. Although the results may appear to be intuitive, work is one of the first to provide evidence that sleep loss is causing anger.

Other studies have shown a link between sleep and anger, but questions remained about whether sleep loss was to blame or if anger was responsible for disrupted sleep, said Zlatan Krizan, professor of psychology at Iowa State. The research, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, answers those questions and provides new insight on our ability to adjust to irritating conditions when tired.

“Despite typical tendencies to get somewhat used to irritating conditions – an uncomfortable shirt or a barking dog – sleep-restricted individuals actually showed a trend toward increased anger and distress, essentially reversing their ability to adapt to frustrating conditions over time. No one has shown this before,” Krizan said.

Study participants were randomly split into two groups: one maintained their normal sleep routine and the second restricted their sleep by two to four hours each night for two nights. Those who maintained averaged almost seven hours of sleep a night, while the restricted group got about four and a half hours each night. The difference reflects sleep loss we regularly experience in everyday life, Krizan said.

To measure anger, Krizan and Garrett Hisler, an ISU doctoral student in psychology, had participants come to the lab – before and after the sleep manipulation – to rate different products while listening to brown noise (similar to the sound of spraying water) or more aversive white noise (similar to a static signal). Krizan says the purpose was to create uncomfortable conditions, which tend to provoke anger.

The participants were randomly divided into two groups: one maintained normal sleep routine and the second restricted sleep for four to four hours each night for two nights. The banned group lasted about four and a half hours each night and continued to sleep for almost seven hours a night. Crisis, daily life in our lives reflects the loss of sleep, he said.

**Sleep loss increases negative feelings**

Crisis, sleep loss, anxiety and sadness, such as increasing the negative emotions, happiness and enthusiasm, such as reducing positive emotions, he said. He and feelings typically measured these effects to better understand the relationship between sleep, anger and emotions. The crisis, he says, has found the loss of sleep to uniquely affect anger and is not only the result of feeling more negative at that moment.
